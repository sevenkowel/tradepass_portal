IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

Trading foreign exchange, contracts for differences, and other financial instruments on margin carries a HIGH LEVEL OF RISK and may not be suitable for all investors.

KEY RISKS:

Leverage allows you to control a large position with a relatively small deposit. While this can magnify profits, it also magnifies losses. You may lose more than your initial investment.

Financial markets are volatile and unpredictable. Prices can change rapidly due to economic events, political developments, or market sentiment.

3. LIQUIDITY RISK
In certain market conditions, you may not be able to close positions at desired prices.

System failures, internet connectivity issues, or platform malfunctions may affect your ability to trade.

5. COUNTERPARTY RISK
The Company is your counterparty for all trades. If the Company becomes insolvent, you may lose your funds.

6. CURRENCY RISK
Trading in currencies other than your base currency exposes you to exchange rate fluctuations.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT:

- You understand the risks involved in trading
- You have sufficient knowledge and experience to trade
- You can afford to lose your entire investment
- You have sought independent financial advice if necessary`,
